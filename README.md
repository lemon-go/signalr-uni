JavaScript and TypeScript clients(compatible with [DCloud/uni-app](https://uniapp.dcloud.io/)) for SignalR for ASP.NET Core and Azure SignalR Service.

This repository is base on [@microsoft/signalr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/signalr) `Version: 5.0.5`, and it's compatible with uni-app. So you can use it the same way you use @microsoft/signalr.

The root folder is for building, and the documentation is [here](signalr#readme).
